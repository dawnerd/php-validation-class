 | The following code is licensed under the Buy Me Dew
 | license. Essentially you can use this code however
 | you want, all I ask if that you buy me some
 | Mountain Dew. I see it as a fair trade off:
 | I work a few hours and give you a free script
 | and you give me some caffeine so I can make more
 | free scripts. Oh, and you have to keep this little
 | blob of text so others know to buy me some Dew.

 | Provides a simple way to perform validation on
 | POST and GET variables. Can verify many data formats
